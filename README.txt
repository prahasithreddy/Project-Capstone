CS50 WebProgramming using Python and JaveScript 

Project 5 : Capstone 

	I personally spend a lot of time on Websites like Reddit and Quora. So I decided to build a small website like that where people can create an account login and post a blog and other users can post comments and give their point of view on the post or blog.The main page consists of a side bar which displays all the recent blogs and catogories of the posts. when you click on a blog the it displays the entire content of the blog where you can post your comments.

Media file:- The media file of all the post images and profile images used by the users to register for the website or to post a blog.

Templates:- It consists of all the HTML content of the website.
 
Static - assets:- Consists of the CSS and Js required for the Project.

Static - vendor:- Consists of the bootstrap and jquery for the project website.

Static - ckeditor :- It consists of code to customize the text content the user is posting for the blog.

Modules.py: - This file consists of all the individual body parts of the projects like user details, categories, Post requirements,                          Comment requirements.

admin.py:- It consists of different levels of authorization for the users to be given by the website admin.

urls.py:- It is used to link the python code and javascript code with the different URLs.

views.py:- The most important parts of the code like creating the post, registration of a user, login of a user, processing of the                   comments posted my the user is taken care of by this file.

Next Step:- Next I'm trying to integrate a Live chat function into this website and Poling option which I think are pretty fun extensions.
